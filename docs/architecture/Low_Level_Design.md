- Generate, issue, validate, refresh, and revoke authentication tokens.
- Protect secured API endpoints using authenticated session or token-based access.
- Maintain authentication status and session security for registered users.
- Return the authenticated user context for the current session.

### Module Dependencies

- Depends On: `users`, `refresh_tokens`, `user_sessions`, and `audit_trails`.
- Produces: registered user accounts, authenticated sessions, authentication tokens, token validation results, and authenticated user context.

---

### Functional Requirements

- The system shall allow registered users to log in using valid authentication credentials.
- The system shall validate submitted signup and login data before processing authentication.
- The system shall generate authentication tokens after successful login.
- The system shall allow the system to validate access tokens for protected API requests.
- The system shall allow the system to refresh authentication tokens using a valid refresh mechanism.
- The system shall allow authenticated users to log out and invalidate their active session or refresh token.
- The system shall deny access to protected resources when authentication tokens are missing, invalid, expired, or revoked.
- The system shall allow the system to return the authenticated user context after successful token validation.
- The system shall restrict secure application features to authenticated users only.

---

### Business Rules

- Signup shall create a valid user account before login is allowed.
- Only registered and active users shall be allowed to authenticate into the system.
- A user must provide valid login credentials before authentication tokens can be issued.
